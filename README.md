# JAVA interview based programs
## This repository contains interview based programs in java that are asked in the company exams and during the interview.

    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
```
### Explaining the example code 1
#### Here in the above program whatever written inside the main function gets executed first in it's respective order.
```
public static void main(String args[])
```
#### class : This Keyword is used to declare a ```class``` in Java
#### public : Here the ```public``` means that all the other methods or functions of ```LearnCoding``` class can access the ```main``` method.
#### void : Here ```void``` means that the ```main``` method should not return anything.
#### static : For any particular function of any particular class, if you want to use any method of any class we need to create objects. Whenever you create an object of a class it requires memory. If you declare something ```static``` you can invoke or revoke that method without using any objects. Hence it saves memory because we don't need to create any object here.
#### public static void main (psvm) : It;s the first function that is being executed in Java.
#### main : It represents the starting point of the program.
#### String[] args : It is used for command line argument. Here the name of the String array is args but it is not fixed and user can use any name in place of it.
