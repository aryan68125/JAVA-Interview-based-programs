## class :
### This Keyword is used to declare a class in Java
## public :
### This is an access modifier that represents visibility. It means it is visible to all.
## static :
### This is a keyword. If we declare any method as static, it is known as the static method, The core advantage of the static method is that there is no need to create an object to invoke the static method. The main() method is executed by JVM, so it doesn't require creating an object to invoke the main() method. So, it saves memory.
```
public class LearnCoding
{
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
```
